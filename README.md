C Code for Robot "Find and Dance" Novel Behavior (KISS IDE)

This code was implemented using KISS Robotics KIPR Link Controller and a custom robot chassis with one IR sensor, one camera sensor, two wheels, and a front bumper sensor. 

The behavior implemented by this code is for the robot to wander until it finds a blue object larger than some threshold size, approach the object, then perform a dance. This is meant to approximate a mating ritual.
